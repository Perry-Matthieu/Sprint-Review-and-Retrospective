# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I define user requirements and desired user design and functionality. 
User stories are detailed descriptions of desired implemented functions. They outline how the user will interact with the product and the desired outcome of that interactivity.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
create overarching design and work my way down into the smaller details. Things don't always go according to plan I know that ahead of time so I allot myself enough time to account for variations in plan. In my future developement work I would primarily like to incorporate sprint planning, sprint retrospective, and sprint review processes. These will allow me to better plan future work and reflect on completed work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Be good at communication, provide clear and concise questions and statements. Provide constructive critisism and be open to changes and new ideas. Accept failures as part of the developement process, work with team members for mutual improvement.
