# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I define user requirements and desired user design and functionality. 
User stories are detailed descriptions of desired implemented functions. They outline how the user will interact with the product and the desired outcome of that interactivity.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Be good at communication, provide clear and concise questions and statements. Provide constructive critisism and be open to changes and new ideas. Accept failures as part of the developement process, work with team members for mutual improvement.
